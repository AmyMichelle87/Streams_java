Manipulating a Stream Invoice

Use the class Invoice to create a List of Invoice objects. Use the sample data shown in the Fig.
Class Invoice includes four properties

• a PartNumber (type int ),

• a PartDescription (type String ),

• a Quantity of the item being purchased (type int ) and
• a Price (type double ).

Perform the following queries on the List of Invoice objects and display the results:
a. Use lambdas and streams to sort the Invoice objects by PartDescription , then display the results.

b. Use lambdas and streams to sort the Invoice objects by Price , then display the results.

c. Use lambdas and streams to map each Invoice to its PartDescription and Quantity , sort the
results by Quantity , then display the results.

d. Use lambdas and streams to map each Invoice to its PartDescription and the value of the
Invoice (i.e., Quantity * Price ). Order the results by Invoice value.

e. Modify Part (d) to select the Invoice values in the range $200 to $500.
